Pattern Coverage 

1.Two pointers (normal + fast/slow)

2.Sliding window (fixed + variable)

3.Prefix sum

4.Kadane

5.HashMap / frequency map

6.Binary search (index-based + on answer)

7.Greedy

8.Heap (Top-K, merge K)

9.Monotonic stack / queue

10.Backtracking (subset, permutation, combination sum)

11.Dynamic Programming (1D, 2D, Knapsack, LIS, String DP)

12.Trees (DFS/BFS, LCA, height, diameter)

13.Graphs (BFS/DFS, islands, cycle, topo sort)

14.Union Find (DSU)

15.Bit manipulation (XOR, masking)

16.Math (GCD, sieve, fast exponentiation)
