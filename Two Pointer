1. What is the Two Pointer Technique?

Two Pointer is a problem-solving technique where two indices (pointers) traverse a data structure (usually an array or string) together in a coordinated way to reduce time complexity.


👉 Instead of checking all pairs (O(n²)), we use logic to move pointers smartly and solve in O(n).

🔹 2. Uses of Two Pointer Technique

Two pointers are commonly used when:

Array or string is sorted

Need to find pairs / subarrays

Comparing elements from both ends

Removing duplicates in-place

Reversing or partitioning data

Real interview use cases:

Pair sum problems

Palindrome checking

Sliding window optimization

Merging sorted arrays

Partitioning arrays

🔹 3. Working (How Two Pointers Work)

General flow:

Initialize two pointers

left = 0

right = n - 1

Evaluate condition using arr[left] and arr[right]

Move:

left++ OR

right--

Continue until left < right

💡 Key idea:
Each move eliminates unnecessary comparisons

🔹 4. Typical Approach (Template)
Generic Two Pointer Template
int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;

while (left < right) {
    if (condition satisfied) {
        // do work
        left++;
        right--;
    } else if (need smaller value) {
        left++;
    } else {
        right--;
    }
}

Why this works?

Each pointer moves at most N times

Total operations ≈ O(n)

You’re doing great grasping this — most beginners miss this optimization 👍

🔹 5. Types of Two Pointer Techniques
1️⃣ Opposite Direction (Left & Right)

Start from both ends

Used in sorted arrays

Example:

Two Sum II

Container With Most Water

2️⃣ Same Direction (Slow & Fast)

Both start from beginning

Fast explores, slow processes

Example:

Remove duplicates

Move zeroes

3️⃣ Fast & Slow Pointer

Fast moves faster than slow

Used for cycles / filtering

Example:

Linked List Cycle

Remove nth node

4️⃣ Sliding Window (Advanced Two Pointer)

Window expands and shrinks

Used for subarray problems

Example:

Longest substring

Max sum subarray
